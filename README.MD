# What is it?

Template for creating simple cross-platform application with GUI based on Qt.

You can go straight to developing widget contained target functionality.

**Features:**

* Ready-to-go template.
* Cross-platform. Can be build for Windows, Linux, any OS that Qt support.
* Minimal architecture and directory structure, to keep coupling low.
* Settings system, with OS independent storage and behavior.
* Test suites and code coverage already setup.
* Code style enforcing tooling.
* Internationalization support.
* Build in memory leaks detection.
* No Boost.
* Cmake as build system.
* Basic CI, based on GitHub Actions.

# How to build?

## Requirements installation

You need Qt 5.12 at least.

### Windows

Install Qt from [official site](https://www.qt.io/download).

### Linux

Examples for Ubuntu 20.04, for another version or distributive refer to [Qt Wiki](https://wiki.qt.io/Main).

```shell
sudo apt install build-essential qt5-default qttools5-dev-tools
```

### Other systems

See [Qt Wiki](https://wiki.qt.io/Main).

## Build

In-source build restricted. From source folder do:

```shell
cmake -S. -Bbuild
cmake --build build
```

# Example

Directory `src/example` contains code that show how to create application on this boilerplate.

1. Inherit your main window class from `UtilityMainWindow` class instead of `QMainWindow`.
2. Initialize UI in constructor by Qt documentation, add you widget and so on.
3. Override getExtensions(), getFileReadMode(), getFileWriteMode() to specified file types and read-write modes.
4. Override loadFile(fileName) and saveFile(filename) implementing read and write file from disc. See example for basic
   variant.
5. Implement isDocumentModified() and clearDocument() this let window to keep track of document state.
6. Delegate methods cut(), copy() and paste() to your widget.
7. In `main.cpp` change `MainWindow` to your class.

# Internationalization support

This boilerplate code include Qt internationalization support.

You need to create application translation files to make it work.

Take a note, for now module `utility_boilerplate_qt5` support only 2 languages:

1. English - in-built to sources
2. Russian

Pull requests with another language are welcome.

## How to assemble new translation?

ru_RU as example, use your language code.

1. Collect all strings inside `tr()` to TS file using `lupdate`.

   ```shell
   lupdate *.cpp -ts i18n/ru/app_ru.ts
   ```

2. Open it in translation tool and translate.

   ```shell
   linguist i18n/ru/app_ru.ts
   ```

3. Qt can load only one translation file at ones, so you need to collect a complete translation file with `lconvert`.
   Search for Qt `qtbase_<language code>.ts` in distribution package
   or [repository](https://github.com/qt/qttranslations/tree/dev/translations) and place it in to `i18n/<language code>`
   folder. Next merge TS files to one using `lconvert`.
   ```shell
   cd i18n/
   lconvert -i ru/*.ts ../../utility_boilerplate_qt5/i18n/ru/*.ts -o ru/appcomp_ru.ts
   ```

4. At last convert TS file to QM file using `lrelease`. Build system automatically copy all QM files to appropriate
   location, where binaries can find it.

   ```shell
   lrelease ru/appcomp_ru.ts ru/appcomp_ru.qm
   ```

5. To check that translation load correctly run application from command line and look
   for `Translation for "<language code>" load successfully` message. If translation can't be load you
   see `Can't load translation for "<language code>"` message. Qt do not offer more debug information for that.

# Code style enforcement

Project offer code style enforcement via clang-format and cmake-format. IDEA styles included.

Style workflow failed if any project file has bad formatting.

Format enforcing ignored if requirements not installed.

## Install requirements

### Windows

`clang-format` can be [downloaded](https://llvm.org/builds/) with LLVM package.

`cmake-format` installed using `pip`.

```shell
pip install cmakelang pyyaml
```

### Linux

Normally, linux systems has all requirements, except `cmake-format`.

```shell
pip install cmakelang
```

## Using

See Format.cmake [documentation](https://github.com/TheLartians/Format.cmake) for details.

Check format of all project files.

```shell
cmake --build build --target check-format
```

Fix all files in project.

```shell
cmake --build build --target fix-format
```

# Build in memory leaks detection

Boilerplate have memory leaks detection based debug_new technics implemented by NVWA library.

Can be enabled on Linux and Mac by adding `-DNVWA` on build.

Disabled on Windows due poor compatibility.
